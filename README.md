First Aid Assistance - Full Stack Project (Java + React)

Project Description
This project is a digital solution for providing first aid assistance. Users can enter their injury details, and the system will use Google API to identify and display a list of nearby volunteers.
The user can then send a request to a volunteer, who will receive an email notification with the option to approve or decline the request.
Additionally, the system allows registered users to set reminders for taking medication and to ask and answer medical questions. The entire process is secured using JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication.

Tech Stack
Backend: Java (Spring Boot)

Frontend: React.js

Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token)

API: Google API for volunteer location services

Features
Nearby Volunteers: When the user enters an injury, the system sends the user's location and searches for nearby volunteers using Google API.

Volunteer Request: After displaying nearby volunteers, the user can send a request to a volunteer, and the volunteer will receive an email notification with the option to approve or decline the request.

Medication Reminders: Registered users can set medication reminders for multiple times a day, and the system will send notifications accordingly.

Q&A Section: Users can post medical questions and receive answers from the community.

JWT Security: The application is secured with JWT for user authentication.


Note:
This project is the first one I developed in the field of software development.
It represents my initial challenge working with Full Stack technologies (Java and React),
and it was a great opportunity for me to learn and experiment with technologies such as JWT,
integrating external APIs (Google API), and building cloud-based solutions.
